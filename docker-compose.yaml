# HOW to run the whole MERN application with the docker container.
# 1. Install docker on your machine, and docker desktop app as well.
# 2. In the root directory, run 'docker-compose build --no-cache' to build the network and containers.
# 3. Run 'docker-compose up' to start the services within the network 'codelikepro-network'.
# 4. Run 'docker-compose stop' to stop services.
